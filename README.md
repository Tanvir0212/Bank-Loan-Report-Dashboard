# Bank-Loan-Report-Dashboard


I developed a comprehensive Bank Loan Report Dashboard using Power BI to visualize and analyze key loan performance metrics for a financial institution. This dashboard gives a detailed view of loan performance with metrics like:

✔️ Total Loan Applications
✔️ Funded vs. Received Amounts
✔️ Good vs. Bad Loan Ratios
✔️ Avg. Interest Rate & DTI
✔️ Loan Status Overview

The dashboard, with user-friendly visuals and dynamic filtering, enables stakeholders to quickly assess loan health and make data-driven decisions.

📊 Built using SQL, Power BI, DAX, and solid data modeling skills.

Proud to keep growing my data analytics journey, feedback is always welcome! 💡
